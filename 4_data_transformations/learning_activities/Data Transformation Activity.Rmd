## Gapminder Transformation

Load the gapminder data into a dataframe called df

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)

```

Transform the data to find the mean life expectancy and total population for each continent at each year in the data. 

```{r}

```

Create a new variable called pop_exp that is the ratio of total population by mean life expectancy
```{r}

```


Filter for years after 1970 and continents Asia and Europe then sort the data by year

```{r}

```

Visualize how the ratio of population and life expectancy change over time for Asia and Europe
```{r}

```
