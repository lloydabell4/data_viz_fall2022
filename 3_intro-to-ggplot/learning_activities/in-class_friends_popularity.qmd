## Learning Activity: Creating a visualization

Let's continue our exploration of this Friends data. I want you to now create your own visualization that explores the how the show Friends' popularity changed over time.

Instructions:

-   1 Create a new object that contains your visualization (use the friends_info dataset)
-   2 Use a geom to create a scatterplot that maps time to the x axis and USA views to the y axis
-   3 Make sure your visualization has a proper title and axis labels

```{r Exercise: Creating a Visualization}
#your code here
