#Set up Code
```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(babynames)
```

#Find the top names from your birth year
Find the top five (boy or girl) names from your birth year and assign the output to a table. Hint (use the slice(1:5) function to 'cut off' the top 5 rows of a dataset)

```{r}
top_5 <- babynames%>%
  filter(year == 1983&sex == "M")%>%
  arrange(desc(prop))%>%
  slice(1:5)

top_5
```

#Visualize the popularity of those names (and yours) across all of the years
Now I want you to look at the popularity of those names (as well as your name) across all of the years in the dataset. This requires a strong working knowledge of the filter() function. 

```{r}
babynames%>%
  filter(sex == "M" & (name %in% top_5$name | name == "Andrew"))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y= prop))+
  geom_line(aes(color = name))
```
