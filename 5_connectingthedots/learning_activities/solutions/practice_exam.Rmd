## Understanding the COVID pandemic in Henrico County VA

You’ve been recruited by the Virginia Department of Health to help better understand the impact of COVID on the people of Virginia.

This exam is your opportunity to demonstrate that you have a foundational knowledge of data visualizations and exploratory data analysis as well as the skills to use the R coding language to manipulate and visualize data.

Each question requires the synthesis of multiple concepts / skills, partial credit is given for all questions so answer as best you can. 

Good Luck!

There are two datasets that you'll need to explore for this exam:

- covid_data_by_week: This dataset has 5 variables: 
    1. Age_Group: Identifies the age range of COVID patients in Henrico County
    2. week_of: Indicates which week the data is pulling from
    3. sum_cases: the total number of covid cases reported that week
    4. sum_hospital: the total number COVID patients hospitalized that week 
    5. sum_deaths: the total number of deaths attributed to COVID that week 

- covid_data_sex: This dataset has 6 variables:
    1. Sex: Identifies the reported sex of COVID patients in the greater Richmond area
    2. week_of: Indicates which week the data is pulling from
    3. sum_cases: the total number of covid cases reported that week
    4. sum_hospital: the total number COVID patients hospitalized that week 
    5. sum_deaths: the total number of deaths attributed to COVID that week 
    6. HDistrict: Indicates which county the data is from
    

```{r import data and packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, output=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)

covid_data_by_week <- read_csv("data/covid_data_henrico_byweek.csv")
covid_data_sex <- read_csv("data/covid_data_greaterrichmondarea_byweek_sex.csv")
```

## Section 1: Henrico County Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Age Group

**Question 1:** Using the dataset covid_data_by_week, write the code required to create this visualization:
![image1](images/image1.png)

```{r Question 1 code, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "center"}
covid_data_by_week %>%
  group_by(Age_Group)%>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(sum_cases))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Group, y = total_cases, fill = Age_Group))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  guides(fill = "none")+
  labs(title = "Total Number of COVID Cases Across Age Groups in Henrico County", 
       x = "Age Group", y = "Total Number of Cases")


```
Note that you had to do a data transformation to get full credit for this question. Creating a geom_bar or geom_col on the data in combination of stat = 'identity' got you close but did not properly compute the sum of cases / hospitalizations. See the negative bars in the visualization below.  

```{r error in question 1-2, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "center"}
covid_data_by_week %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Group, y = sum_cases, fill = Age_Group))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  guides(fill = "none")+
  labs(title = "Total Number of COVID Cases Across Age Groups in Henrico County", x = "Age Group", y = "Total Number of Cases")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-1,10))

```

**Question 2:** Create a visualzation (similar to question 1) that answers the question: which age group has the most hospitalizations? **80+ years**

```{r Question 2 code, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 9, fig.align = "center"}
covid_data_by_week %>%
  group_by(Age_Group)%>%
  summarise(total_hos = sum(sum_hospital))%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Age_Group, y = total_hos, fill = Age_Group))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity')+
  guides(fill = "none")+
  labs(title = "Total Number of COVID Cases Across Age Groups in Henrico County", 
       x = "Age Group", y = "Total Number of Hospitalizations")
```


**Question 3:** Describe the insights that these two visualizations suggest about the pandemic in Henrico County Virginia.

How would you explore whether these trends have changed over time? No need to code for this question but be sure to use the terminology that we've discussed in class.

-------

The 20-29 age group has the highest number of COVID cases and the 80+ age group has the lowest number of COVID cases. This is stark contrast to the number of hospitalizations. 80+ individuals have the most hospitalizations out of all the age groups - almost 3x the number of hospitalizations of the 20-29 age group. 

There are a number of ways to examine whether these insights were consistent across time. One way would be to facet across week but in all likelihood that would create too many visualizations to be useful. Instead summarizing the week_of data but month and faceting across month might yield a better understanding of the relationship between age group and COVID cases/hospitalizations. 

-------

**Question 4:** The COVID-19 vaccines have been available to adults for most of 2021.

Describe (in complete sentences and using the terminology we’ve used in class) what the code below does. Feel free to describe the code line by line if you'd like.  


```{r Question 4 code}
summer_months <- c("May", "June", "July", "August")

do_vaccines_work <- covid_data_by_week %>%
  mutate(year = year(week_of),
         month = month(week_of, label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE))%>%
  filter(month %in% summer_months)%>%
  group_by(year, Age_Group)%>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(sum_cases),
            total_hospitalized = sum(sum_hospital),
            total_deaths = sum(sum_deaths))%>%
  mutate(percent_hospitalized = total_hospitalized / total_cases, 
         percent_death = total_deaths / total_cases)
```

------

summer_months is a new object that contains the output of the c function. The c function creates lists or vectors and, in this case, the values within that list are 4 strings that are the summer months. 

do_vaccines_work is a new object that contains the output of a large series of piped functions based on the covid_data_by_week dataframe. 

The mutate fuction creates two new variables: year and month. Both use the year() and month() functions to exact the year and month information from week_of. The month () function uses two arguments that returns the full name of the month. 

The filter function filters rows / observations for months (found in the column months) found in my summer_months vector.

The group_by function allows me to indicate which variables I want to summarize below. In this case, I'm grouping by year first then age_group. 

The summarise function, in conjunction with the sum() function, allows me to create three new variables that sum cases, hospitalization, and deaths across my groupings (year and Age_group). 

Using those new summed variables, I use the mutate function to calculate the percent of hospitalized patients and deaths by divided the new summed variables by total cases.

------

**Question 5:** Building on your response from question 4, what is a specific insight that you can derive from do_vaccines_work? What would be an effective way to visualize that insight?

No code required here - just identity the components you would use in your visualization.

----------

The resulting dataframe, do_vaccines_work offers me the opportunity to compare the outcomes of COVID positive patients for years 2020 (pre vaccine) and 2021 (post vaccine). 

```{r Percent Hospitalized Across 2020 and 2021, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(do_vaccines_work, aes(x = Age_Group, y = percent_hospitalized, fill = as.factor(year)))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")+
  coord_flip()
```
```{r Percent Deaths Across 2020 and 2021, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(do_vaccines_work, aes(x = Age_Group, y = percent_death, fill = as.factor(year)))+
  geom_bar(position = "dodge", stat = "identity")+
  coord_flip()
```

By visualizing the rates of outcomes for COVID patients by Age Group and Year, you can see that for many age groups hospitalization and death rates dropped. There are some exceptions but you could reasonably conclude that there was a significant decrease in rates in 2021. Whether this drop was directly the result of vaccinations would require additional data but the data suggests further exploration should be done. 

------


## Section 2: Greater Richmond Cases, Hospitalizations, and Deaths by Sex

**Question 6:** Examine the data in covidsex_data.

Write an exploratory data analysis (EDA) question based on the data that would deepen our understanding of the role of sex (male or female) on COVID-19 outcomes. 

Note you may want to look at questions 7 and 8 before completing this question.

-------

Were males COVID patients hospitalized at a higher rate than female COVID patients in the greater Richmond area?

-------

**Question 7:** What data transformation(s) (if any) and visualizations are required to answer your EDA question?

No code required but describe in detail how you’d approach your EDA question. Break down each data transformation and visualization component. 

-------

I'll need to create a data transformation that creates a new table that calculates the sum of sum_cases and sum_hospital by Sex. Then using those new variables, I'll create a new variable per_hos that calculates the rate of hospitalizations. 

With that data, I'll use a simple bar plot to visualize the comparison of hospitalization rate by Sex. 

```{r}
sex_table <- covid_data_sex %>%
  filter(Sex == "Female" | Sex == "Male")%>%
  group_by(Sex)%>%
  summarise(total_cases = sum(sum_cases),
            total_hospital = sum(sum_hospital),
            total_deaths = sum(sum_deaths))%>%
  mutate(per_hos = total_hospital / total_cases,
         per_death = total_deaths / total_cases)

sex_table
```

-------

**Question 8:** Create a visualization with R that answers your EDA question.
```{r Code for Question 8, , fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6, fig.align = "center"}

ggplot(sex_table, aes(x = Sex, y = per_hos, fill = Sex))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', width = 0.5)+
  labs(title = "Hospitalization Rates Not Significantly \nImpacted by Sex in the Greater Richmond Area", y = " % Hospitalized \n COVID patients", x = "Sex")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,.1))+
  annotate("text", x = 1.6, y = .045, label = "Females 0.003% less likely to be hospitalized")+
  guides(fill = "none")+
  theme_classic()

```
