#Set up Code
Load the tidyverse and babynames packages
```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```

#Find the top names from your birth year
Find the top five (boy or girl) names from your birth year and assign the output to a table. Hint (use the slice(1:5) function to 'cut off' the top 5 rows of a dataset)

```{r}

```

#Visualize the popularity of those names (and yours) across all of the years
Now I want you to look at the popularity of those names (as well as your name) across all of the years in the dataset. This requires a strong working knowledge of the filter() function. 

```{r}

```
