### Top 5 Names from your Birth Year

Find the top names from your birth year Find the top five (boy or girl) names from your birth year and assign the output to a new object. Hint (you can use the slice(1:5) function to 'cut off' the top 5 rows of a dataset)

```{r}

```

### Top 5 Names Across the Years

```{r}

```
